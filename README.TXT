COUGAR FRAMEWORK
================

The Cougar Framework is an object-oriented application framework for PHP 5.4 or
above. Cougar aims to simplify the development of RESTful APIs by integrating,
simplifying and optimizing security, URI routing and database access.

Cougar is not a general-purpose framework. It only focuses on making it easier to
create RESTful APIs. It does not have shopping carts, templeting, or much in the way
of an interface.

Cougar gets its name from the mascot at Brigham Young University where the framework
was originally developed. Alberto Trevino <alberto@byu.edu> is the main maintainer.
