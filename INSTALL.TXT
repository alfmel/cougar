INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

If you are installing for regular use, the easiest is via Pear:

  pear channel-discover alfmel.github.com/pear
  pear install cougar/cougar

If you are installing for development, get it straight from Github:

  git clone https://github.com/alfmel/cougar

Make a symlink to cougar/cougar.php somewhere in a directory in your PHP include
path or add your repo directory to your PHP include path. You may also want to
symlink the following to /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin:

  /path/to/cougar/Cougar/Model/cougar-model-builder
  /path/to/cougar/Cougar/PDO/cougar-create-pdo-connection-file
  /path/to/cougar/Cougar/Util/cougar-obfuscate-string

Enjoy!
